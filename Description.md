# Quantum-HHL-Simulation
Simulation and analysis of the HHL quantum algorithm to solve linear systems, focusing on a 2D non-Hermitian system converted to Hermitian form. Developed using PennyLane for the ECS417: Quantum Computation course at IISER Bhopal, this project demonstrates the efficiency, modifications, and challenges of quantum computational methods.
