# Quantum HHL Simulation Project

This repository contains the documentation, and analysis for implementing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm to solve linear systems using quantum computing principles. The project focuses on solving a specific 2-dimensional non-Hermitian linear system, converted into a Hermitian form, and simulating the solution using the PennyLane framework.

## **Project Overview**
The HHL algorithm is a cornerstone of quantum computation, enabling efficient solutions to linear systems of equations in \( O(\log N) \) compared to \( O(N) \) in classical computation for sparse matrices. This project builds upon prior research by:
- Transforming non-Hermitian systems into Hermitian systems.
- Implementing quantum circuits with three registers: ancilla, eigenvalue encoding, and solution registers.
- Modifying and simulating the algorithm using PennyLane.
- Comparing theoretical and simulated results.
